Overview:
    lanManager is a Linux based, local area network auditing program, that uses UDP and TCP port connections to monitor devices connected to a LAN.
    All data collected by the program will be uploaded and accessible on a webpage, where you can monitor devices on your LAN from one location.
    
    The sections below will provide information on using the program, accessing the webpage, and editing the configuration file.

Using the Program:
    Before running lanManager on your device, check the configuration settings located within the labAuditConfig.ini file.
    If you already installed the program on your machine, then navigate to the default install directory /etc/lanManager/
        Once inside the /etc/lanManager/ directory, open the labAuditConfig.ini file, and change the settings accordingly:

            MulticastIP=(Your desired multicast IP)

            MulticastPort=(Your desired multicast port)

            TcpIP=(This should be the set to the IPv4 of device running the server)
                *If you dont know the IPv4 of the machine that will be running the server use the 'ifconfig'
                terminal command and use the "inet addr:" number of your primary interface for this field*

            TcpPort=(Your desired TCP port)

            UpdateRate=(How often the server updates the contents of its' database in seconds)

            ScanRate=(How often the server pings your broadcast IP)
                *ScanRate tells the program to ping the LAN broadcast IP based on UpdateRate.
                For example: UpdateRate=30, ScanRate=3 --> (30 * 3) = ping the broadcast IP every 90 seconds*

            lanIP=(This should be set to your LAN broadcast IP)
                *If you dont know your LAN broadtcast IP, use the 'ifconfig' terminal command
                and use the "Bcast:" number of your primary interface for this field*

    When running lanManager, the program can be ran in two primary modes, server and client.
            By default the program will attempt to run in client mode unless the user tells the program otherwise
            When launching the program, there are several commands the user can run
            "-h" will list the available commands for lanManager
            "-v" will show which version of lanManager is installed
            "-s" will run the program in server mode
            "-t" will force the program to run in client mode
            "-d" will run the program as a daemon (the program will run as a background process, and write to a log file)
            "-r" will reset the program's database files before running the program so only the most up-to-date info is shown on the webpage
            "-c" will allow the user to enter an alternative configuration file name for the program to use
                    ***NOTE: The alternate configuration file should use the same setup, and variable names, as labAuditConfig.ini!!!***

    Devices running in server mode will be required to have Apache2, SQLite3, and nmap installed on the local system to function.
    Once a device launches lanManager in server mode, the program will begin running based on the settings found in labAuditConfig.ini.
    After reading in the labAuditConfig.ini file, the program will begin auditing your LAN, and will update the webpage with all relevent information.

    For additional information, and commands 

Locating the Webpage:
    Apache2 is used as the main web server for lanManager, and the content of this section will be described as it pertains to apache2.
    The computer running the server will also run the program webpage found in the /var/www/ directory. 
        (Depending on your system apache2 may installed a var/www/html/ directory, and the lanManager website will be installed that directory aswell)
    To access your webpage, launch a web browser and type in "(Your server IP)/lanManagerWeb/index.php" into the address bar.
        (Your server IP will be the same IP you used for TcpIP in the labAuditConfig.ini file)
    If your apache2 and lanManager have been installed correctly, then you should be able to see the the Overview page for your LAN.
    From the Overview page, you will be able to navigate to multiple different sections of the webpage, and learn more about devices currently running lanManager on your LAN.
